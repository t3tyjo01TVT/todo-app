## part 1: Creating basic app structure

Started a new React project for frontend. Added functions addTask and deleteTask and created a basic input field and a list to display tasks. At this point can add and delete tasks, but since there is no backend, refreshing the page will wipe out the data.

## part 2: Creating backend

Created server folder, installed modules express, cors, pg and nodemon. Created first get, post, delete http-requests. Created and tested backend connection to database.

## part 3: Automated testing

Created first tests, to test creating and deleting tasks.
